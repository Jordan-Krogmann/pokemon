pokemon_df <- read_csv(file = here::here("data","pokemon.csv")) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(type2 = case_when(
    is.na(type2)~ "none",
    TRUE ~ type2
    )
  )
```

## EDA

To mimic their project I guess they use tree-based models to predict wether or not a Pokemon is legendary.

It seems they got legendary happy in the 7-generation of Pokemon... Not sure what games those are since I haven't played since *Pokemon Red*.

```{r generation-legendary}
pokemon_df %>% 
  group_by(generation) %>% 
  summarise(
    count_total = n(),
    count_legendary = sum(is_legendary),
    percent_legendary = sum(is_legendary)/ n()
  ) %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  fmt_percent(
    columns = vars(percent_legendary),
    decimals = 1
  ) %>% 
  tab_header(
    title = md("**Legendary Pokemon by Generation**"),
    subtitle = md("Does not include *Sword & Shield*")
  ) 
```


If you look at legendary count type one it looks like 
```{r plot-type-legendary, fig.align='center', fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
pokemon_df %>% 
  group_by(type1) %>% 
  summarise(
    count_total = n(),
    count_legendary = sum(is_legendary),
    percent_legendary = sum(is_legendary)/ n()
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(type1, percent_legendary),y = percent_legendary))  +
    geom_col(aes(fill = type1), color = "black") + 
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, .4, by = .1), labels = percent) +
    expand_limits(y = .4) + 
    theme_minimal() + 
    theme(
      axis.text = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14),
      axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14),
      axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
      plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 16, hjust = .5),
      legend.position = "none"
    ) + 
    labs(
      title = "Percent of Legendary Pokemon by Type",
      y = "Percent",
      x = ""
    )
    
```

## Modeling

```{r modeling-data}
# training data frame
train_df <- pokemon_df %>% filter(generation != 7) %>% 
  select(
    -c(abilities, japanese_name , name, generation, percentage_male)
  )

# testing data frame
test_df <- pokemon_df %>% filter(generation == 7)%>% 
  select(
    -c(abilities, japanese_name , name, generation, percentage_male)
  )
```

```{r model-recipe}
# model recipe
poke_recipe <- recipe(is_legendary ~ . , data = train_df)
```

```{r model-caret}
caret(
  formula = is_legendary ~ .,
  data = train_df,
  method = "randomforest"
)


```
